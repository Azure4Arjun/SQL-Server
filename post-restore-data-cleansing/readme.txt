This is a simple solution for non production environments. The idea is to erase non critical data in order to leave the database smaller in size. This would allow a future shrink to give the saved space back to the operational system. I reckon that the scripts themselves might not be used by you in your environment, but you can get a sense of the logic and steps required to achieve the end goal.
