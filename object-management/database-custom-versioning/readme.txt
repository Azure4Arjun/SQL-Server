Use these scripts to setup a custom versioning of your main development objects within the database. This can help you control the changes that occur, allowing you to take action when
particular changes occur in the environment. I reckon that there are better solutions for that (check out Red gate and Apex solutions), but they are expensive. So if you looking for 
a solution that is simple and easy to deploy, perhaps this can help you out.

There scripts rely on the objects created in the previous folder.
